        wss://your_server_address:5443/WebRTCAppEE/websocket
        - streamId: The stream id that you use in your connection. You either play or publish with this stream id.
        - token: If you active one-time token on server side, you should enter token value in here. If one-time token is not activated, just leave empty
        - mode: The Mode of the Client. It should .play, .publish or .join. If it's .play, it means your WebRTC client will play a stream with your streamId
        - streamerName: Streamer name
        on the server. If it's .publish, it mean your WebRTC client will publish stream with your stream id.

        - useExternalCameraSource: If useExternalCameraSource is false, it opens the local camera. If it's true, it does not open the local camera.
        When it's set to true, it can record the screen in-app or you can give external frames through your application or BroadcastExtension. If you give external frames or you use BroadcastExtension, you need to set the externalVideoCapture to true as well
